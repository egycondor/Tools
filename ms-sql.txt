# to access ms-sql via kali

apt-get install sqsh freetds-bin freetds-common freetds-dev
Once done, we’ll need to edit /etc/freetds/freetds.conf, and append the following to it:

[MyServer]
host = 192.168.1.10
port = 1433
tds version = 8.0
And lastly, we’ll edit ~/.sqshrc:

\set username=sa
\set password=password
\set style=vert

Finally by issuing:
sqsh -S MyServer

RECONFIGURE;  
GO  

xp_cmdshell 'dir c:'
